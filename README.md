# ðŸŒ¿ Landscaping & Gardening - Landing Page

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a beginner-level landing page built from a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/wpeL99pHRHTYwgEDws4j7k/Landscaping-Gardening-Service-Landing-Page--Community-?node-id=401-45&m=draw) using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Itâ€™s part of a training track Iâ€™m currently enrolled in, aiming to improve my frontend development skills by practicing real UI designs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Convert a Figma design into a real website layout.
- Practice and improve HTML/CSS fundamentals.
- Learn about page structure, spacing, and visual hierarchy.
- Understand how to build clean, responsive layouts.

## ðŸ“š Tools & Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- VS Code  
- Figma (for UI reference)

## ðŸš€ Status

- This project is still in progress.
- The layout is being built manually without frameworks like Bootstrap.
- Responsiveness and fine details will be added step by step.

## ðŸ’¡ About Me

I'm currently learning **HTML/CSS** as part of a DEPI_R3.  
This project reflects my current stage as a frontend Angular beginner working on real design implementation.
